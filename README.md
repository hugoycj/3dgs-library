# 3DGS-Library: An awesome 3DGS models library
Welcome to the 3DGS-Library, a curated collection of state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) methods and popular NeRF datasets. This repository aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a one-stop-shop for evaluating and comparing different 3DGS techniques on a diverse set of NeRF datasets.

The 3DGS-Library contains implementations of 5 popular 3DGS methods, including:
* Vanilla 3DGS
* Scaffold-GS
* Mip-Splatting
* GaussianShader
* SuGaR

These methods have been carefully selected to represent the latest advancements in the field of 3D geometry synthesis.

In addition to the 3DGS methods, the library also includes **15 widely-used NeRF datasets, covering a variety of scenes and object types**. This extensive dataset collection allows users to thoroughly evaluate the performance of 3DGS models across different challenges and settings.

The primary goal of the 3DGS-Library is to **facilitate the comparison and benchmarking of 3DGS techniques**, enabling researchers and developers to make informed decisions when selecting the most suitable methods for their specific use cases. By providing a standardized environment and a comprehensive set of resources, we aim to accelerate the progress in novel view synthesis research.

We encourage the community to actively **contribute to the 3DGS-Library by submitting new 3DGS methods, or NeRF datasets**. Together, we can build a valuable resource that drives innovation and advances the state of the art in novel view synthesis and related fields.
